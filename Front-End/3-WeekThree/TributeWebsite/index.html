        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Jane Austen (December 16, 1775 â€“ July 18, 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, 
                which critique the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century.</p>
            <p>Austen's novels were not widely recognized during her lifetime, but she is now considered one of the most influential writers in English literature. 
                Her most celebrated works include "Pride and Prejudice," "Sense and Sensibility," and "Emma," 
                which have been praised for their keen social commentary and masterful use of irony.</p>
            <p>Born in Steventon, Hampshire, Austen spent most of her life in the rural south of England. 
                She began writing at an early age, and her family was supportive of her literary pursuits. 
                Her first major novel, "Sense and Sensibility," was published in 1811, followed by "Pride and Prejudice" in 1813, 
                "Mansfield Park" in 1814, and "Emma" in 1815. Despite the initial anonymity she maintained, 
                her works gained some recognition and positive reviews during her lifetime.</p>
            <p>Austen's writing offers a vivid portrayal of the society she lived in, with a focus on marriage, social standing, 
                and the economic realities faced by women. Her novels often explore the dependence of women on marriage for social standing and economic security. 
                Austen's sharp wit and insightful observations have ensured her novels remain relevant and widely read to this day.</p>
            <p>Although her life was relatively short, Austen's impact on literature has been enduring. 
                Her works have inspired countless adaptations in film, television, and theatre, as well as numerous literary imitations and continuations. 
                Her novels are celebrated for their timeless themes, memorable characters, and the deft way they balance romance and realism.</p>
            <p>Austen's correspondence with her family and friends provides valuable insights into her thoughts on writing and her views on the society of her time. 
                These letters, along with her unfinished works and juvenilia, form an important part of her literary legacy. 
                Jane Austen's work continues to captivate readers worldwide, cementing her place as one of the great writers of English literature.</p>
