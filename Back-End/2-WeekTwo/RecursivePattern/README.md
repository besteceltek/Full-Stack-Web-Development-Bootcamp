# Pattern with Recursive Methods

Project with a recursive method without using a 
loop, complying with the following rule according 
to the n value received from the user

**Rule:** Subtract 5 from the entered number until the 
entered number is 0 or negative. Print the last value 
on the screen during each subtraction. After the 
number becomes negative or 0, add 5 again. Again, 
print the last value of the number to the screen with 
each addition.
